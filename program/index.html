<h2>Social event after the workshop  </h2>
We are organizing a lunch after the workshop. ICSE will cover a two course sit down meal and a three hour beverage
package (beer, wine and soft drinks) at the selected venues.  The idea is to have the opportunity to discuss with our keynote speakers, committee and people involved.
