				<p  align="justify">We face a new software crisis. 
			        In 1968, computer scientists learned that developing robust software requires skills, methods, and tools. Today, software and hardware engineers realize that developing a robust Internet of Things (IoT) also pushes the states of their art and practice. Recent news illustrate the many problems faced by IoT: from lack of inter-operability to broken updates to massive security attacks. In this context, the International Workshop on Software Engineering Research & Practices for Internet of Things (SERP4IoT) aims to provide a highly interactive forum for researchers and practitioners to address the challenges of, find solutions for, and share experiences with the development, release, and testing of robust software for IoT devices.
With the huge success of previous years, and the subsequent success of our <a href="https://moar82.github.io/ieee-iotj-si-serp4iot/"  target="_blank"> special issue </a> on the <a href="https://ieee-iotj.org/" target="_blank">IEEE IoT Journal</a>, we welcome researchers from all the world to participate in this workshop.  
We plan a workshop out of the conference format, where rearchers, and practitioners can exchange ideas, participate in group dynamics, and contribute.  Do not miss it!
