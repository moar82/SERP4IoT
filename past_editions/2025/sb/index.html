<h1>Submission guidelines</h1>

<!-- <h2>To be announced ...</h2>-->


<p>Prospective participants, from the academy and industry, are invited to submit long (8-pages), short (4-pages), or poster (1-page) papers describing their work or ideas related to the workshop topics. Short and long papers should identify challenges, discuss opposing viewpoints, outline processes, or present solutions related to any aspects of software engineering for IoT. Authors will have the choice to publish or not their papers (short/long) in pre- and post-proceedings. </p>

<p>Formatting: The paper format of the Workshop’s paper must follow the IEEE formatting guidelines, see also&nbsp;<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_Workshops/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_Workshops/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>&nbsp;<br>(title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTEX users must use&nbsp;<br>\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the&nbsp;<br>compsoc or compsocconf option).</p>

<p>
Papers must have a maximum length of 8 pages. It is not possible to pay for extra pages.
Please submit your paper through <a target="_blank" href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=serp4iot25"> EasyChair </a> .
</p>

<p> The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM or IEEE Digital Libraries. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.”
“Purchases of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed
</p>

<p>The Workshop may designate a small number of accepted papers for “best paper award" (or equivalent). These awards are by no means linked to the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards that ICSE 2025 will designate separately.</p>
