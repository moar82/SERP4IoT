<h3>ABSTRACT:</h3>
<p>The ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and our growing reliance on IoT apps make their dependability more critical than ever. Known for providing the highest degree of software assurance, software verification uses mathematical concepts to prove the correctness of specific properties. Among the notable developments is the emergence of lightweight formal methods, which enable automated, yet formally-precise analysis in an effort to reduce the burden on traditional formal verification techniques. In this talk, I will present the ongoing research in my research group, exploring the possibility of leveraging lightweight formal methods backed by automated program analysis for pragmatic dependability analysis of IoT systems in a compositional and scalable fashion. I will illustrate the ideas in the context of practical applications, discuss their potential for moving the field forward, and pose essential areas of research in the coming era.</p>

<h3>BIO:</h3>
<p>Hamid Bagheri is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He is a faculty associate of the Institute for Software Research (ISR) at the University of California, Irvine. Bagheri is a co-director of the ESQuaReD Laboratory at UNL. Prior to joining UNL, he was a project scientist in ISR at University of California, Irvine, and also a postdoctoral research fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from University of Virginia in 2013. His research interest lies in Software Engineering and Formal methods, with a focus on advancing software dependability by developing new methods and tools relying on concepts from fields like lightweight formal methods, software synthesis, model-driven development, and software architecture. His publications in several top venues have been recognized as best papers.</p>

<h3>BIO:</h3>
<p>Prof. Ursula Eicker is the Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) in Smart, Sustainable and Resilient Cities and Communities at Concordia University Montreal. She is a German physicist who received her PhD in Solid State Physics from Heriot-Watt University and her Habilitation in Renewable Energy Systems from the Berlin Technical University. Prof. Eicker has held leadership positions at the Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences and its Centre for Sustainable Energy Technologies, and has coordinated many international research projects in the fields of building energy efficiency, renewable energy systems and urban scale simulation.</p>
<p>Since June 2019, she has led an ambitious research program to establish transformation strategies toward zero-carbon cities. Around 50 graduate students work on pathways to zero-carbon cities in the domains of the built environment, renewable energy systems, sustainable transport and circular economy.</p>
