<h1>Submissions</h1>

<!-- <h2>To be announced ...</h2>-->


<p>Prospective participants, from the academy and industry, are invited to submit long (8-pages), short (4-pages), or poster (1-page) papers describing their work or ideas related to the workshop topics. Short and long papers should identify challenges, discuss opposing viewpoints, outline processes, or present solutions related to any aspects of software engineering for IoT. Authors will have the choice to publish or not their papers (short/long) in pre- and post-proceedings. 

Submissions should use the official “ACM Primary Article Template”, as can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template page. LaTeX users should use the sigconf option, as well as the review (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers). To that end, the following LaTeX code can be placed at the start of the LaTeX document: \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} \acmConference[ICSE 2024]{46th International Conference on Software Engineering}{April 2024}{Lisbon, Portugal}


Papers must have a maximum length of 8 pages. It is not possible to pay for extra pages.

Please submit your paper through <a target="_blank" href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=serp4iot24"> EasyChair. </a>   The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by ACM. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2024. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
